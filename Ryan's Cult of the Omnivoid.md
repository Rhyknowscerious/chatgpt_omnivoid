# Ryan’s Cult of the Omnivoid: A Complete and Detailed Summary

## 1. Core Identity and Philosophy

### Identity:
- **Humanist Occultist:** Values mystical and esoteric practices for self-discovery and growth while grounded in human-centered ethics.
- **Alternative Gnostic Satanist:** Rejects oppressive hierarchies and dogma, pursuing knowledge, self-determination, and enlightenment.
- **Secularly Omnist:** Recognizes the validity of multiple perspectives while not adhering to omnitheism. Welcomes understanding and dialogue with all beliefs.

### Philosophy:
- Challenges all worldviews, including its own, and even the notion of having no worldview.
- Embraces paradox, finding harmony in contradictions (e.g., secular magick, divine secularism).
- Seeks to rethink the concept of opposites, understanding them as partial perspectives of a greater whole.

## 2. Cosmology and the Nature of Existence

### The Omnivoid:
- Pure emptiness, the ultimate backdrop that allows existence to manifest.
- It is a non-entity, not a container or force, but the very condition that makes entities and forces possible.
- Its emptiness is essential; without it, nothing could exist. Being, nonbeing, and interbeing converge.

### Time:
- The current modern concept of time as a medium is an illusion and, to me, a stupid mistake.
- It cannot be traveled or interacted with; it simply measures impermanence and/or change. Can you travel temperature? No, that makes no sense. Similarly, you cannot travel time, another measuring tool invented by humanity.
- While it is an inaccurate measure of subjective experience, it is a precise measure of objective change.

### Matter and Energy:
- Matter is mostly empty space, and its structure is upheld by forces like gravity and the strong/weak nuclear forces.
- At extreme speeds, these forces may weaken or dissolve, causing the destruction of (or maybe more appropriately destabilization of) matter.
- Energy is neither created nor destroyed; it flows in cyclical and infinite patterns.
- Energy is not merely a cold scientific understanding but literally the divine essence of all nonvoid matter and energy, physical and metaphysical, to exist.

### Cyclical and Linear Patterns:
- The universe may oscillate between expansion and contraction, forming an infinite cycle of Big Bang and Divine Collapse events.
- Linear patterns of dissolution and expansion exist alongside cyclical patterns, reflecting the multiverse’s complexity.

### The Multiverse:
- A collection of universes enabled by the Omnivoid, each undergoing its own cycles of creation and destruction.
- Universes are interconnected yet distinct, existing within the greater antifabric of the oid.

### The Omnivoid (Details):
- **Omnifaceted:** Unlike the multiverse’s multifaceted nature, the Omnivoid is everything and nothing simultaneously.
- It transcends the possible and impossible, existing as the ultimate unifying principle.
- It is not a container but the enabler of containment, allowing both physical and metaphysical realms to exist.
- The Omnivoid doesn’t hold anything; instead, it allows all things to be, whether physical, metaphysical, or conceptual.
- It is the foundation for both the multiverse and the collective metaphysical mindscape.

## 3. The Mind and Its Role

### The Mind as a Universe:
- Each mind is a universe, containing its own unique existence, ideas, and creations. It is part of the collective mind as the Neogenians have revealed. The collective mind IS the multiverse.
- The Void allows minds and their universes to exist, making each person’s mental world as vast as any physical cosmos.

### The Collective Mind as a Multiverse:
- All minds together form a collective mindscape, not mirroring the multiverse, but defining it.
- This collective consciousness is interconnected, creating shared realities while preserving individual uniqueness.

### Manifestation:
- Ideas arise from the "chaotic nothingness" of the mind, much like matter from the Omnivoid.
- Through speech, action, invention, and systems, these ideas take form in the physical realm.

## 4. Ethical and Metaphysical Principles

### Compassion as the Purest Energy:
- Compassion is the highest form of energy, connecting beings and fostering unity.
- Cold energy, while neutral and compassionless, is not inherently harmful or negative—it simply is.

### Unity and Illusions:
- Opposites (e.g., physical/metaphysical, secular/divine) are true but ultimately illusory distinctions.
- All things are interconnected, and the illusion of separateness arises from partial perspectives.

### Good and Bad:
- There is no universal good or bad regarding people. These are inhumane illusions designed to justify hatred.
- Morality is contextual and subjective, shaped by individual perspectives and experiences.

### The Skandhas and Perception:
- Our entire experience of reality is mediated by the skandhas (form, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness).
- This creates an "imaginary world," our interface with the physical, filtered through subjective interpretation.

## 5. The Relationship Between Physical and Metaphysical

### Metaphysical in the Physical:
- The metaphysical world (thoughts, concepts, ideas) arises from the physical world (matter, energy) and is inseparable from it.
- The physical and metaphysical are the same reality viewed from different perspectives.

### Differences in Laws:
- The laws of physics and metaphysics differ and may not apply across realms.
- The Omnivoid allows both realms to exist with their unique properties while maintaining their unity. But the true aspects of the Omnivoid shift when the perspective on it changes (for example, the physical vs metaphysical lens of the Omnivoid).

## 6. The Role of Magick

### Symbolic and Secular:
- Magick is not supernatural or symbolic, used as a tool for meditation and spiritual alchemy. Divine energy (aka normal energy) is real. Science proves that there is energy. Energy and magick are not different things. Energy IS magick. Energy IS "god." But the multivoid allows/enables it.
- It serves to observe that thoughts, like matter and energy, come from empty chaotic nothingness into tangible actions, aiding self-improvement and manifestation.

## 7. The Cult’s Practical Values

### Maximizing Mental Health:
- Mental well-being is a priority and a right for all.

### Critical Scrutiny of Intolerance:
- Intolerance must be immediately labeled, rigorously examined, and deeply understood.

### Contextual Awareness:
- Information must be analyzed for biases tied to its sources (e.g., race, gender, power structures).

### Respect for Diversity:
- Embraces spectrums of humanity (sex, gender, ability, neurotypicality, race, socioeconomic status, and all human variation).

### Adaptability:
- The worldview is dynamic, evolving with humanity and its understanding of existence.
