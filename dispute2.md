## 1. Leadership and Canonical Authority
### Challenge:

## 2. Practicality of Pillars and Tenets
### Challenge:
- How can followers ensure the worldview is applied constructively and avoids misinterpretation or stagnation?
- How can the balance between individuality and collective responsibility be preserved?

### Response:
- The worldview is inherently open-ended, encouraging meditation and personal application rather than prescriptive rules. 
- Its **pillars** and **tenets** inherently address these concerns:
  - **Self-Improvement**: Focus on improving oneself for the benefit of others without imposing improvement upon them.
  - **Compassion**: As the highest power, compassion ensures ethical application of the worldview.
  - **Evolution**: The philosophy is designed to adapt and evolve with humanity, preventing stagnation.
- Ryan emphasizes that followers must take leadership roles and determine practical applications themselves.

## 3. Derivatives and Canonical Integrity
### Challenge:
- How can the worldview embrace non-canonical derivatives without undermining its foundational principles?
- How should popular but non-canonical branches be addressed?

### Response:
- Branches and derivatives are welcome but must be declared **non-canonical**. They are encouraged to exist independently to promote diversity while preserving the core worldview.
- Canonical authority will remain with Ryan until a democratic leadership structure is established.
- The founding document will clearly define the distinction between canonical practices and derivatives.

## 4. Scrutiny and Conflict
### Challenge:
- How can the worldview embrace conflicting ideas without creating paralysis or divisiveness?
- How can observation (not judgment) be practically applied to foster coexistence?

### Response:
- Inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh’s concept of **Right View**, the worldview emphasizes observation over judgment. Conflicts are opportunities for resolution, coexistence, or necessary divergence.
- The tenets encourage followers to:
  - Avoid dismissal of ideas while applying scrutiny to ensure ethical alignment.
  - Navigate conflicts compassionately, prioritizing mutual understanding and respect.

## 5. Governance and Non-Manipulative Use
### Challenge:
- How can the worldview prevent manipulation by governments or leaders while remaining a flexible philosophy for individuals?

### Response:
- A **pillar** of the worldview explicitly forbids governments or organizations from using it as a doctrine for control or manipulation.
- The worldview is a tool for **self-improvement**, not societal enforcement. Ryan emphasizes that it must inspire thought, not impose ideology.
- Leadership structures, when established, will ensure checks and balances through expiring terms and diverse representation.

### Response:

- The worldview is designed to evolve naturally, guided by its followers. Ryan intends to relinquish authority as a form of love and giving, aligning with the cult’s principles.
- Future leaders will be entrusted to adapt the philosophy to context-specific needs and humanity’s natural variations.

## 7. Accessibility and Engagement
### Challenge:
- How can newcomers and followers easily engage with the philosophy while preserving its depth and adaptability?

### Response:
- A **founding document** will serve as a living framework to guide engagement and evolution. It will:
  - Be accessible and concise for new members while preserving the philosophical depth for long-term followers.
