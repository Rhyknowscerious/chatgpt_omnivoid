# Comparison of the Holy Divine Trinity and the Secularly Divine Trinity

## 1. Nature and Composition
- The **Holy Divine Trinity**:
  - Comprised of **Father**, **Son**, and **Holy Ghost**.
  - Represents the **essence of God**, emphasizing unity within diversity and divine transcendence.
  - Each aspect reflects a unique divine role:
    - **Father**: Creator, the source and sustainer of existence.
    - **Son**: Redeemer, embodying love, wisdom, and salvation.
    - **Holy Ghost**: Sanctifier, fostering divine unity and guiding humanity toward God.

- The **Secularly Divine Trinity**:
  - Comprised of **Body**, **Mind**, and **Spirit**, offering a secular and holistic framework for life and liberation.
  - Each component contributes to the unity of physical, metaphysical:
    - **Body**: The **physical self**, grounding experience in the tangible, material world. Host of the brain. Brain being host of mind. Cohost of the spirit. Cohost of the mind. Cohost of the spirit.
    - **Spirit**: The **metaphysical self**, encompassing the ego, id, superego, and broader identity or anatta. Cohost of the mind.
    - **Mind**: A blending of the physical neurological control center (*brain*) with the metaphysical neurological control center (*spirit*). Defined by the magickal formula **1b+1s=1m**, where brain (**b**) and spirit (**s**) combine to cold-kindle the antispark of pure chaotic void emptiness we know as the mind (**m**). Compassion is possible through this simultaneous presence and absense of light and dark warm and cold energy. Infinite and finite potential. Cohost of the spirit.
