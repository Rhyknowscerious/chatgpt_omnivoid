# Incremental Progression: Discussion on Ryan's Cult of the Omnivoid

## Summary of Key Points

### 1. Addressing Potential Issues in the Philosophy
#### Subjective Morality and Compassion
- **Clarification**: The absence of universal "good" and "bad" is coherent when humanism is foundational. 
- **Context**: Good, bad, compassion, and suffering exist solely within the metaphysical realm, tied to the human mind and collective experience.
- **Philosophical Insight**: Compassion mitigates suffering, making it a guiding principle within temporary human existence. 
- **Avoiding Nihilism**: The worldview opposes extinctionism and nihilism, holding human life as inherently significant despite suffering.

#### Interconnectedness and Individuality
- **Tenet**: Harming others is self-harm, and vice versa. Love is an act of giving, rooted in self-love.
- **Philosophical Principle**: Detachment ensures freedom from toxic attachments while maintaining engagement with the world.
- **Governance**: Governments should exist to benefit humanity, emphasizing cooperative efforts to maximize mental health and well-being.

### 2. Refinements to the Framework
- **Humanism as Foundational**: Good and bad, compassion, and morality are constructs within the human experience, not universal constants.
- **Dependent Origination**: All things depend on each other, reinforcing interconnectedness.
- **Practical Ethics**: Detachment combined with engaged love fosters balance and mental health.
- **Governance and Philosophy**: Governments must align with humanistic principles, prioritizing collective well-being.

### 3. Resolution of Potential Issues
- **Subjective Morality**: Framed as tools for mitigating suffering, compassion operates within a metaphysical scope.
- **Balance of Principles**: The tenets on love, self-control, and governance create actionable and consistent ethical guidelines.
